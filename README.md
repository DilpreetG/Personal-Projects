## Network Subnetting Calculator

This project is a network subnetting calculator designed to assist in IP address and CIDR notation conversions. It was created using Python and the ipaddress module. The calculator provides the following functionalities:

1. **IP and CIDR/Subnet Conversion:** Enter an IP address and its corresponding CIDR/subnet mask, and the calculator will display the network address, broadcast address, and usable IP range.

2. **CIDR to Subnet or Subnet to CIDR (N/A):** This feature is currently under development.

3. **To Be Determined (TBD):** This section is reserved for future enhancements or additional features.

The code provided here is a simplified version designed to display in the shell of an IDE, the actual code soon-to-be used on my personal website will be modified for deployment. The calculator helps in understanding network configurations and is a practical tool for network engineers and enthusiasts.

Feel free to explore and contribute to the project! Stay tuned for future updates and improvements.
